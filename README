Java Heap Analyzer

This is the front end to our heap visualization system, Heapviz.

This program does the following:
1) takes as input an HPROF heap dump file in binary format
2) parses it
3) builds a graph where each object instance is a vertex and each pointer/
reference is an edge
4) optionally summarizes the graph
5) outputs the graph in GraphML format

I have provided a sample HPROF heap dump file in bh.hprof.  Output is stored
in the images directory.

Running:
1. Type this command at the prompt:
   % java edu.tufts.cs.eaftan.heapvis.Parse bh.hprof
   "bh.hprof" is the name of an Hprof heap dump file.  If the heap dump file 
   contains more than one heap dump, we will generate GraphML for both.

   You may optionally give the option "-nosummary" to skip the summarization
   step:
   % java edu.tufts.cs.eaftan.heapvis.Parse -nosummary bh.hprof
